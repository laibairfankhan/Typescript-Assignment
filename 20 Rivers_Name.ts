//Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

// Create an array to store the names of rivers.
const Rivers_name: string[] = [`Jhelum`  ,`Soan `, `Indus`, `Beas`];

//Print a message to introduce the list.
console.log(`The list of RiversName.`);

// Use forEach to go through each river in the list and print its name.
Rivers_name.forEach(Rivers_name => console.log(Rivers_name));
